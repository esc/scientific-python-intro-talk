Scientific Programming and Best Practices using Python
------------------------------------------------------

The Python programming language, has become a popular competitor for
doing scientific computing over the last five years and is commonly used
throughout disciplines ranging from neuroscience to atomic physiques.
It is used for many tasks such as performing data acquisition, data analysis,
running simulations, visualization or results, high performance
computing and prototyping of algorithms.

During this talk I will discuss why I believe Python to be an ideal
candidate for scientists and highlight some of the important libraries
such as Numpy, Ipython and Matplotlib. Also, I will outline how some
best practices from the software development industry, -- such as unit
testing and version control -- can be leveraged for scientific
programming.

I will conclude the talk with pointers to reference materials for
learning and teaching as well as an overview of conferences and
workshops in Europe.
